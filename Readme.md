# NFT Evolution Contract

## Project Description
Build NFTs that evolve based on time or user actions. This smart contract creates dynamic NFTs that automatically grow and change their evolution level through user interactions, providing an engaging and interactive digital collectible experience on the Aptos blockchain.

## Project Vision
To revolutionize the NFT ecosystem by creating living, breathing digital assets that respond to user engagement. Our vision is to transform static NFTs into dynamic companions that grow alongside their owners, creating deeper emotional connections and long-term value through interactive evolution mechanics.

We envision a future where NFTs are not just digital art pieces, but interactive digital entities that reward user engagement and create unique, personalized experiences for each holder.
